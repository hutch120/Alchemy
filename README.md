# Owners comments

Alchemy 1 was launched in Cape Town in 2007 and her first owners put her into crewed charter in Key West, Florida for her first 5 years. Despite being in charter the condition of the woodwork, Corian benchtops and equipment are in very good condition. Maintenance by the subsequent owners has ensured the boat is in very good condition and has the appearance of a well loved and cared for boat.

She was then purchased in USA by an Australian couple who cruised the Caribbean and sailed her across the Pacific to Australia and on arrival paid all the import duties/taxes and registered her as an Australian ship. After selling the boat they then purchased a Leopard 48 in USA.

The current owners purchased her in Australia in Jan 2016 and carried out extensive upgrades with a $200,000+ refit including new sails, rigging, motors/saildrives, electronics and much more.

The current owners have cruised over 25,000 miles in the South Pacific including NZ, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and East Coast Australia.

The skipper is a Professional Engineer and has had over 50 years sailing experience having built a yacht and sailed it around the Pacific including New Guinea and Solomon Islands in the 80&#39;s.

The search for the perfect catamaran for long distance cruising adventures was one that was based on previous sailing experience both on catamarans and monohulls. The choice of available designs is extensive and the owners understood the need to balance a fast lightweight low load carrying capacity racing catamaran with a slower higher load carrying capacity model.

The choice of length is very important if you are planning on ocean voyages. It is also a compromise and too short makes for uncomfortable sailing in rough swells and too long equates to the need for crew and more cost in the purchase price. The most popular length for short handed cruising is 45&#39;.

A catamaran with good sailing performance but also good for cruising was the Leopard 46 with its spacious interior with a dining table to seat 8 , aft cockpit with a table to seat 10 and a brilliantly designed helm station that seats up to 3. Access to the helm is via a stainless ladder in the cockpit.(New 2016). The helm station provides a protected position with single handed operation of the genoa and mainsail sheets and mainsail traveller. For long distance sailing or in rough windy wet conditions this helm station is very much a necessity not just a luxury. Steering out in the open is OK in good weather for day sailing but not an option for long distance. The design of this elevated helm station is one of the many reasons for choosing a Leopard 46.

The accommodation with 2 x queen size beds in the aft cabins and 2 x double beds forward along with a kids bunk forward of the Port cabin also meet with our requirement to occasionally entertain family and guests. All cabins have adequate storage lockers including hanging lockers. They also provide high quality solid doors for privacy and separate spacious heads with corian washbasin with mixer tap and mirrored vanity unit with large separate shower stall with doors. All marine toilets are oversized and all electric.

With the addition of the 6&#39; long fibreglass folding bowsprit and a 122 m2 screacher you have the ability to achieve relatively fast passage making with a fully loaded boat (6000 kg max includes full fuel and water tanks). The screacher is furled once the apparent wind reaches 20 knots. A speed of 12 to 14 knots on a beam reach and 20 knots apparent wind can be achieved with a fully loaded boat. You also need to consider having sufficient propulsion and this is achieved with the Yanmar 54HP diesel motors that propel the boat along at 7.5 knots (single motor 2000 rpm) or if you need to make your anchorage before dark or a storm you can run both motors and achieve up to 9 knots at 2500 rpm.

The owners spend a lot of time in the aft cockpit area which with the addition of well designed and strong awnings it makes this area an extension of the saloon. The awnings have windows that can be rolled up depending on the temperature and in cooler parts of the world or winter in Queensland they make for a very cosy warm area to relax and entertain.

The helm or pilot station is also fitted with protective roll up clears for forward viewing and the sides and rear awnings are made with a mix of roll up clears and Sunbrella type fabric to protect the crew from the sun and rain.

The owners have custom fitted hard wearing and easy cleaning external carpet in the aft cockpit (faux teak pattern) which makes for a soft cool surface to walk on. The Leopard 46 was the last model fitted with high quality stainless steel framed doors and windows between the saloon and aft cockpit.

The Leopard 46 design and build is very strong and evidence of this is the fact that most of these boats were sailed around the world by professional crews to deliver them to new owners. Approximately 200 of this model were built before the end of production in 2012.

The current owners as a couple have no problem sailing long distance without crew. They have also found when having guests on board that the private 4 cabin layout with individual bathrooms all with Jabso large electric Quite Flush toilets makes entertaining up to 6 people easy work and enjoyable both for the owners and the guests.

All cabins are fitted with large 600x600 overhead hatches and fans. The aft cabins have additional rear opening small port window and all cabins have large fixed windows just above water line. The windows are all fitted with fabic sun block blinds on a sliding track. The overhead hatches have fly screens and sun block screens. All cabins and saloon are air conditioned but with the design of the hatches providing good cross flow ventilation it is rare that the air conditioning is required except in the tropics in summer. Not a good place to be in the cyclone season.

The rear awnings and all the hatches in the salon and cabins and bathrooms have insect screens and sunshades.

If you are looking for a catamaran for cruising the Australian Coast or the Pacific or further away it is hard to go past a Leopard 46 and one that has had extensive upgrades making for an enjoyable experience similar to owning a new boat. Alchemy 1 has a fastidious owner who has refitted it so that it is ready to go anywhere in the world without the need for paying for upgrades.

**Galley/ Saloon**

The Leopard 46 galley up design incorporates a spacious saloon area in a cherry wood finish with a wide U shaped settee and an aft facing galley with plenty of room to circulate. A softly curved Corian cocktail bar overlooks the adjoining cockpit area, enabling drinks to be served directly to the cockpit.

The U shaped galley incorporates Corian bench tops, double deep stainless sinks with mixer tap and overhead cabinets. The cupboards below bench level easily store cooking gear, plates and incorporate sliding drawers for the cutlery and other kitchen items. Catering is no problem with the large fridge and freezer system to Port with well insulated compartments with wire shelving and stylish stainless steel doors.
